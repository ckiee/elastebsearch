# elastebsearch

Quick and dirty Elasticsearch Firefox intergration.

## Setup

-   Install and run Elasticsearch.
-   Open the server directory, install the dependencies using yarn and run it.
-   Currently the extension is still under review but once it is up you will be able to download it from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elastebsearch-client/).

    But, for now - you can disable extension signing in about:config and install from file in about:addons if you are using Firefox Developer Edition.
